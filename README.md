Vegetaran Restaurant in Every State

This is just a set of scripts that I use for collecting data for the [Vegetarian Restaurant in Every State Blog](http://veg-rest-in-every-state.blogspot.com/)

Run the getstates.rb to get rss data for each state, then you can run the diff.sh to get counts and differences from the original.

The parse-usa.rb will limit results to food carts or restaurants.   Download the feed and save it as usa.rss, or switch the comments to download automatically.
